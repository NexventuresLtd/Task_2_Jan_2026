# This project contains three sections namely, Hero, Services, and ContactForm.
* I used the following blue print
  > Firsly, I cloned the git repo using "git clone https://github.com/NexventuresLtd/Task_2_Jan_2026.git"
  > Secondly, I created my custome branch using "git checkout -b abay-tessema" 
  > And then, I created a react application using vite under that folder/repo I just cloned
  > After that, I structured all the files using best practice approach
  > Then, I worked on the individual components and pages
  > Finally, I pushed my code to my branch I already created
* Tech stacks I used include:
  > React.js
  > TypeScript
  > Tailwind CSS
  > Vite
* How you can run this project locally
  > Go to the application, which is 'client' in this case, using "cd client"
  > Then run a command, "npm run dev"
