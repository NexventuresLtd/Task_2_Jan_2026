# Portfolio Website

## Project Overview

This project is a **single-page responsive portfolio website** built using **React (Vite + TypeScript)** and **Tailwind CSS**.
The portfolio showcases my **skills, experience, and contact information** in a clean and visually appealing way.

The page contains **three main sections**:

1. **Landing / Introduction Section**

   * Displays your **name**, **experience**, and a **call-to-action button**.
   * Acts as the first impression of the portfolio.
   * Focuses on typography, spacing, and responsive layout.

2. **Services & Skills Section**

   * Highlights your **technical skills** as **Frontend, Backend, and Full-Stack**.
   * Structured in a card or grid layout for clarity.
   * Emphasizes content hierarchy and layout consistency.

3. **Contact Section**

   * Includes a simple **contact form UI** (frontend only).
   * Shows your **contact details** for easy communication.
   * Fully responsive and user-friendly layout.
