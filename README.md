# This project is a government services portal where citizens can apply and track their status via dashboard.
=> Tech stack I used include the following:
 1) TypeScript
 2) Vite
 3) Tailwind CSS
=> The challenges I faced:
  1) I had a hard time figuring out what exactlly I was required of to acomplish. I had to take a longer time than I normally expected to actually understand the requirements.
  2) Since I am used to the normal javaScript and forms without types, I found it a little bit difficult to validate forms and come up with appropriate types for props to be passed.
  3) The built-in TypeScript types were not familiar for me and I was struggling to get comfortable with them.
=> How I approched the project/challenge?
  1) I took much more time to understand the problem than writting the code
  2) Secondly, I structured my files in a predictible way
  3)  I, then did a research on the best practices from ui/ux perspective
  4)  Finally, I worked on individual components and pages
=> Extra infos:
  1) I used react-hot-toast to notify successful submissions or failures
  2) I used setInterval function to simulate the real world application status change in the dashboard
=> What I have learned from the project:
  1) Form validation
  2) Props
  3) Managing states
  4) UX/UI design
  5) Best practices to structure files in a project
